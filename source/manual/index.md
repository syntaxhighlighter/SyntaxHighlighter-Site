This is the manual page, it's friendlier than other manual pages, in some circles even known as "THE manual". Please consult it first for any TextExt related question, and if you don't find your answers, please consult it second and third. If all else fails, use the towel to wipe your tears and then reach out to me on the TextExt Twitter hot support line. The "hotness" of said support line may or may not be actually all that hot. The temprature will vary greatly based on your time zone, my time zone and whenever or not somebody recently purchased the whole shenanigans.

If you are curious what "TextExt" stands for, not unlike the "PHP", it's a double reverse self referencing anagram where "TExt" expands to "TextExt". Also stands for "Text EXTREME!!!!" with that exact number of exclamation signs and to only be said out loud with the coarse, rustic, honed in one hundred battles kind of voice.

For the sake of filling in the rest of the page with something useful, here's the "README" again. If you are asked once again to refer to the manual page, you may skip this step at your leisure since you are already on that page.
